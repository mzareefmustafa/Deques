A Double Ended Queue (deque) implementation using both linked lists and arrays, while involves writing tests for these implementations and solving real-world problems using the deque.

# Key features:

Implementing deque operations: addFirst, addLast, isEmpty, size, printDeque, removeFirst, removeLast, get.

LinkedListDeque.java: Implementing a deque using linked lists, adhering to specific rules on efficiency and memory usage.

ArrayDeque.java: Implementing a deque using arrays, ensuring constant-time operations and proper resizing.

Implemented the following, which could be used for situations involving text processing, pattern recognition, string manipulation, etc:

   1. Used the deque to identify standard palindromes.

   2. Extending to generalized palindromes where characters can be off by one.

   3. Implementing off-by-N palindromes.
